## Snake2048
my first python game

!! Notice: this game is not finished!


#### How to play:
1. Run `game.py`
2. Press ```space``` to start
3. Press ```wasd``` to change the direction of the snake
4. Make sure the block the snake is ```eating``` is *smaller than or equal to* the *biggest number in the snake*(the first one) or the snake will crash and died (game over)
5. Don't let the snake crash into the walls
6. Have fun
